# AM64DS Patcher for Wii U

This tool patches the eShop releases of Super Mario 64 DS on the Wii U to accept analog stick inputs with full analog range. The patch puts character movement on the Left Analog Stick, and puts camera rotation on the DPad and Right Analog Stick. The patch also removes the touchscreen camera control buttons to make a clean map on the lower screen.

Once you use this tool, you must run a CFW before starting SM64DS. Without the CFW, the Wii U will give an error when trying to launch the game. Running this tool also requires running a CFW. If you haven't soft-modded your Wii U, follow the directions at [wiiu.hacks.guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/) before using this tool.

**If you are using Haxchi or CBHC installed on SM64DS:** You cannot install the AM64DS patch on the title you installed Haxchi or CBHC, as the Haxchi patch prevents the game from working. This tool will prevent you from installing the patch on a Haxchi-patched title. **DO NOT INSTALL HAXCHI OR CBHC ON AN AM64DS PATCHED TITLE!!!** Doing so will break Haxchi, preventing it from working, and may brick your Wii U if CBHC is used. If you are using SM64DS for Haxchi or CBHC, see [these suggestions to get AM64DS working](Haxchi.md).

To uninstall the AM64DS patch, you need to delete SM64DS from Data Management in System Settings and redownload/reinstall the game.
